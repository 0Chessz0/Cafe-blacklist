  "shortReason": "Harassment, slurs, not reading rules",
  "longReason": "Immediately upon joining, the user began venting about his girlfriend breaking up with him in the general chat instead of using the designated vent/diary channels. Despite being told by Kai and Leo to use the correct channels, he refused. He then became upset and used a racial slur, after which he was warned not to. The user later DMed Kai asking for his number after venting, repeatedly harassed Kai about whether his ex had texted him back, and frequently used the name 'slut' in reference to Kai, which was inappropriate. He also began making comments about death. Kai and Leo both showed clear discomfort, and the user continued the behavior despite being told to stop. He also did not read or follow the server rules.",
